# Dashboard To-Do App

A small **Dashboard Project** built as part of my Intermediate HTML & CSS + JavaScript course.  
This app demonstrates **Grid + Flexbox layouts** combined with **vanilla JavaScript interactivity**.

It’s not production-ready—but it works!

---

## Features

- **Collapsible Sidebar**  
  Click the hamburger menu (`☰`) to expand or collapse the sidebar.

- **Task Creation with Modal**

  - Click **New** → opens a modal dialog.
  - Fill in task details → click **Save Changes**.
  - Tasks are rendered dynamically into the dashboard.
  - You can create as many tasks as you want.

- **Dashboard Layout**  
  Built using **CSS Grid** for the main structure and **Flexbox** for UI details.

---

## Limitations

- Not yet responsive (mobile view will come later in the course).
- Tasks are not persistent (page refresh clears them).
- No update/edit/delete functionality—just task creation.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Grid + Flexbox)**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**
